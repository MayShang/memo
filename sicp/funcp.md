1. programming view as a mathematical activity and mathematical reasoning lies at the heart of our subject.
2. rather than performing actions in a sequence, they evaluate expression.
;; what is evaluate expression, why?
3. A variable in Haskell is a name that is bound to some value, rather than an abstraction of some low-level concept of a memory cell like in imperative languages.
