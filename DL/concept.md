## basic

### supervised
we learn to predict values from labelled data.
useful ML technique is classification.target values are discrete values.
another ML technique is Regression work on target values.the target values are continuous values, stock data.

### unsupervised
we make inferences from the input data that is not labelled or structured.
for example, millions of medical records, 
we have to find the underlying structure, outliers.

useful technique is clustering 
### reinforcement learning

### liner regression

### cost functions

### overfitting

### under-fitting

### hyper-parameter

## data set
* training sets
* testing sets
* validation sets

## date for breakthrough
2012

## difference between deepL and traditional MachineL
challenges is feature extraction.
the programmer needs to be specific and tell the computer the feature to be looked out for.
feature extraction is a critical part of the traditional learning workflow.
for complex problems such as object recognition or handwriting recognition, this is a huge issue.

Deep learning can help us for automatic feature extraction.
the lower layer can be assumed to be performing automatic feature extraction, requiring little or no guidance
from the programmer.

## artificial neural network
it's not a new idea, it's been aroud about for 80 years.
but until 2011, become popular for computers.

### probable model is 
in this model, we have data, we weight it, and pass it through the function in the neuron that called
threshold function or activation function.

feed forward neural network: the act of sending data straight through a neural network.
when we go backwards and begin adjusting weights to minimize loss/cost, this is called back propagation.

this is an optimization problem. with the neural network, in real practice.
