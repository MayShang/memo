by contrast, in a neural network we don't tell the computer how to solve our problem.
instead, it learns from observational data, figureing out its own solution to the problem at hand.

learn from data, and find better models, which can be used for further usage.

2006, deep neural network to help train.
and now this technique achieve outstanding performance on many important problems.
