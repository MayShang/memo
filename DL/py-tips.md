### os
1. [file_i for file_i in os.listdir('folder_name') if '.jpg' in file_i and '000' in file_i]

result: [file_i] a list.

2. `os.path.join`
join folder name and file name
`print(os.path.join('fodername', 'filename'))`

`files = [os.path.join('foldername', file_i) for file_i in os.listdir('foldername') if '.jpg' in file_i]`

3. inside ipython
  - help(plt) or plt.imread? to get help

  - numpy doc
    ```
    from numpy import doc
    help(doc)
    help(np.doc.TOPICS)
    ```

4. module and version check
`python3 -c 'import mo as m; print(m.__version__)'`

`python3 -m pip install --upgrade m -U`

`sudo python3 -m pip uninstall m -U`

5. matrix shape meaning
if `[218, 178, 3]`, `[:, :, 0]` means the 1st channel all data
`plt.imshow(img[:, :, 0])` colon operator to "take every value in this dimension", meaning "give me every row, every column, and the 0th dimensoin of the color channels"

6. image dtype
  - dtype, data type, uint8, uint32, float32
  - `img.dtype` to get image data type
  - `img.astype(np.float32)` to set image data type

7. visiualize image
`img = plt.imread(file_i)`
`plt.imshow(img)`

crop and resize pic
refer to `CADL/session-0` (https://github.com/pkmital/CADL.git)  
`imresize(crop, (64, 64))`

```
from PIL import Image
square = imcrop_tosquare(img)
crop = imcrop(square, 0.2)
rsz = np.array(Image.fromarray(crop).resize((64, 64)))
plt.imshow(rsz)
```

8. difference between `np.array` and `np.ndarray`
In Python, arrays from the NumPy library, called N-dimensional arrays or the ndarray, are used as the primary data structure for representing data.

ndarray is a shorthand name for N-dimensional array, data in an ndarray is simply referred to as an array. `dtype` attribute to get data type, `shape` to return a tuple describing the length of each dimension.
[array ndarray reference](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-n-dimensional-arrays-python-numpy/)

```
from numpy import empty, zeros, ones
a = empty([3, 3])
print(a)
b = zeros([3, 3])
print(b)
c = ones([3, 3])
print(c)
```

9. what is `autoencoders`  
reproduce the input at the output layer, but why? where to use this nn.
  - the goal of an autoencoder architecture is to create a representation of the input at the output layer such are as close(similar) as possible.
  - the actual use of autoencoders is for determining a compressed version of the input data with the lowest amount of loss in data. data not lost, but overall size is reduced significantly. this concept is called dimensionality reduction.

10. art about DL
  - make an algorithm paint an image
  - hallucinate objects in a photograph
  - generate entirely new content
  - teach a computer to read and synthesize new phrases
  - generate music with DL
